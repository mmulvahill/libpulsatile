\title{Calculate Effective Sample Size (ESS)}
\usage{
effective_sample_size(x, max_lag = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of MCMC samples}

\item{max_lag}{Maximum lag for autocorrelation calculation (default: length(x)/2)}
}
\value{
Effective sample size (numeric)
}
\description{
Computes the effective sample size for an MCMC chain, accounting for
autocorrelation. Higher ESS indicates better mixing and more independent
samples.
}
\details{
ESS is calculated as: n / (1 + 2 * sum(autocorrelation))
where the sum is over positive autocorrelations up to max_lag.

Rules of thumb:
\itemize{
  \item ESS > 100: Generally acceptable
  \item ESS > 400: Good
  \item ESS > 1000: Excellent
}
}
